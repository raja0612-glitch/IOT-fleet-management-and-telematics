Abstract:
The "IoT ‚Äì Smart Vehicle Monitoring System" is a real-time vehicle data logging and monitoring prototype built with Arduino. It collects GPS-based data including vehicle speed, location (latitude & longitude), altitude, and direction (course). The system stores this data in a microSD card for historical tracking and displays the current speed on a 7-segment display. The goal is to enhance vehicular monitoring, promote safe driving, and enable GPS-based logging. This system uses simulated and real GPS input and supports offline data logging through SD card integration.
